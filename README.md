A simple javascript game without canvas!

To build a better game experience requires lot of components and skills in designs/animations. In this samples I shared with you a simple way to build a game without HTML5 canvas. All movements are just CSS base which quite nice for a simple games. No installations required. I used CDN Jquery version so no need to download JQuery in your machine.
